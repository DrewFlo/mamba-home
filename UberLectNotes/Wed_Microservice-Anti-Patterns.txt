AntiPatterns vs. Pitfalls

Ap starts good then gets bad
Pitfalls always bad

AP - data-driven migration
  data is a corporate asset
  not an application asset

  break up services first, then data - fix data along the way
  Book - 'Refactoring Databases'

AP - function driven identification
  function-driven
  data-driven
  on their own bad
  use both at same time

AP - all the world's a stage
  doing work that should be done in Devops - staging tech etc.

AP - hop in the bus
  what to do
    contract transformation
    service orchestration

  !Policy summary orchestrator - can build now dummy all data, fill in services as they are created!?!?!

    protocol-agnostic heterogeneous interoperability
    aggregate functionality

AP - timeout
  solve with circuit breaker pattern

AP - reach-in reporting
