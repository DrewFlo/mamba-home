Cloud Native Architecture Migration Strategies
Matt Stine

Software Architecture Podcast

why?
  balance agility and resiliance
  devops and Continous delivery both on Cloud and Architecture

what (cloud native)
  maturity models
    multiple levels
      gives you multiple achievable targets
      easier to quantify effort to move levels
      should develop my own maturity model
      slide 21 example

selection strategy
  consider ROI - cheap not always good, expensive not always bad
  SNAP analysis
  trying to understand:
    technical complexity vs. business criticality
    slide 31

Lift and Shift
  what? cant just move the app, it will need changes.
  whats the MVP (minimum viable port) - least amount of changes to get to the new target environment
  go maturity level 0 to start.  dont be done!  need to improve maturity

Decomposition Strategies
  bounded contexts...
  Value Streams
    from concept to cash - idea to imp - how do we get to the imp/cash
    has a velocity - speed in a given direction - biz says when and where
    let biz have unique streams, better overall
  Single Responsibility Principle
    one class one responsibility
  Failure Domains
    unique reasons to failure per app, with two apps together, two failure points.
    seperate to get one failure point per
  Anti-Corruption Layers
    cleanup data coming from external contexts/systems

Strategic DDD - Domain Driven Design
Bounded Context
  ubiquitous language - words/concepts mean the same to you and me ex. Party/Person
Context map
  how do the BC's interact?

Anti-Corruption Layers
    slide 43
    microservice calls adapter->translator->facade
    adapter - negotiates protocall
    trans - maps data
    facade - fakes out each side to not know about each other

Strangler Pattern (Fowler)
  no new dev in monolith
  new microservice are greenfield/semi-greenfield
    get good at micorservices
  then start replacing monolith functionality
  slide 47
Hexagonal Architecture aka Ports and Adapters
  slide 51
  A - api gateway
  clients call core through API
  core calls legacy/external through API\
Should you Start Cloud Native?
  slide 53
  App Continuum
