Building Reactive Applications

what is reactive programming
  message-driven
  elastic - leverage cloud
  resilient - graceful failures,
  responsive - infinite scrolling, JIT data,
what its not
  multithreading
  futures
  callbacks

  next logical step to functional programming


Respect Failures, from the get-go
  What if error is just another form of data?

Observerable - data flow iterator

Java 8
Stream vs. Observable

Stream                        Observable
dataflow                      dataflow
push                          push
                              end signal
good luck                     treat error as data

Observable
---data channel--- open  closed-as soon as error come thru error channel - circuit breaker concept
---error channel---
---complete channel---
 1 signal thru error or complete channel, never more than 1

 RX java - netflix inspired

 io.reactivex.Observable
